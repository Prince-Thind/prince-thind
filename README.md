# Hello, my name is Prince Thind.

I am a passionate IT analyst with years of hands-on experience building and maintaining my personal projects. Fascinated by information technology, I specialize in Data analysis and am always looking for new opportunities in Montreal. I speak both English and French.

Currently based in Montreal, Canada, I am eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects. I specialize in technologies such as the MERN stack, Java with Spring Boot, Bash scripting, and have strong analytical skills in system analysis and data interpretation. My experience also includes gathering requirements, performing data analysis, and optimizing business processes to align with technology solutions.

I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering (Honors) from Lovely Professional University (LPU), one of the top private universities in India. Additionally, I earned a Graduate Certificate in Information Systems Business Analysis from Northern College, one of the leading institutions in Northern Ontario. I graduated with First Division honors from LPU, driven by a deep commitment to the field of computer science. My academic journey at both LPU and Northern College was marked by a rigorous pursuit of knowledge and a strong passion for technology. This foundation has equipped me with the skills and enthusiasm necessary to excel as a software developer, continually seeking to expand my expertise and tackle new challenges.

Thank you very much for your time, and feel free to contact me with any questions.
